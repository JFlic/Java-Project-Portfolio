# JCK Innovations Commission

My junior year of college I did an e-commerce website commission for a plastics company that started producing their own products. In this web commission I used JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to make the application responsive and modern. I programmed the website using object-oriented programming practices.
