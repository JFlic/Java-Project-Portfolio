# Hammer Built Web Application

The summer of 2024 I had an internship where I built a web application from the ground up for the company Hammer Built. For the web application I used JavaScript, HTML, PHP and CSS. Making sure that the application was responsive and easy to use from a customerâ€™s point of view. Not only this but I also worked very closely with my project manager making sure that they we were on the same page every step of the process. As a result, I was able to produce a great product that the company is still using to this day.
